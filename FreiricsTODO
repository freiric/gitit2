_ TODO 
  _ TOC including subTOC for internal links
    _ process toc separately (need additional functions from pandoc to be exported)
      _ hierarchicalize from Pandoc
    _ cache the toc (as pandoc) and page separately
      _ needs a JSON instance for [Element] (preferrably in Pandoc)
      _ this means deserializing to HTML, preEscapedText
    _ process the page and linked page recursively to get the cache of toc of linked page, aggregate the toc and write it to html, cycle detection
    _ additional steps:
      _ optimization: processing of all page before they are accessed
      _ script the export of linked page as subsections

  _ cope with environement (development, test, staging, production)
    _fromArgsSetting
  _ reference to other config files, e.g. within a config.d (with or without env)
  _ template to start a new site in the style of yesod
  _ adding config option should not break existing code (private constructor)

_ DONE
  _ command-line option to specify config file? (but what about rest of config dir?)
  _ several config files
